### Deployment
This app is configured for GitHub Pages deployment. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

## Key Calculations

### Vesting Formula
Replicates Excel's quarterly vesting logic:
```typescript
const calculateVestedShares = (grantAmount, vestingStart, vestingYears, currentDate) => {
  const monthsVested = monthsDifference(vestingStart, currentDate);
  const quarterlyVested = Math.floor(monthsVested / 3);
  const totalQuarters = vestingYears * 4;
  return Math.min(grantAmount, (quarterlyVested * grantAmount) / totalQuarters);
};
```

### Tax Calculations (Israeli Tax System)
- **RSUs**: ~47% income tax rate
- **Options**: ~25% capital gains tax rate
- USD/ILS conversion with live exchange rates

### Portfolio Valuation
- **RSUs**: `availableShares √ó currentPrice`
- **Options**: `availableShares √ó (currentPrice - strikePrice)` if profitable

## Data Structure

The app uses the same data model as the original Excel file:

- **Grants**: Amount, vesting dates, grant price, stock symbol
- **Exercises**: Exercise amounts, dates, prices, tax calculations
- **Simulations**: Growth scenarios, projected values, tax estimates

## API Integration

Currently uses mock data for demonstration. To integrate with real stock prices:

1. Get an API key from Alpha Vantage or similar service
2. Set environment variable: `VITE_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. Real-time prices will be fetched automatically

- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
